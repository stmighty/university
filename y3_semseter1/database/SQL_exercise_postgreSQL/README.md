1. best practice is in 4.1 and 4.2 you should use table.col not only col (I improve my code in 4.1 and 4.2 after the rest not sure wheter the rest are good practice or not)  
ex. using customer.customer_id is better (practice) than using customer_id even we select only 1 table 

2. in this exercise there is no intermediate So, i will give you another example after 4.16 (more complex)
ex. in this exercise if you have to join table a and table b it always has common attribute
they need not to use table c as a common attribute of table a and table b to join them.

3. revise type of join ex. left join

4. revise 4.15


5. in the slide folder, slide6 has detail of using postgreSQL (technical part)

6. 4.17 is not in aj exercise 




finish revising until 4.10, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.16, 4.17(multiple tables joined)
(not only 4.11, 4.15)
