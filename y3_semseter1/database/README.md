1. Please read README.md in each folder for better understanding.
2. If you forgot anything about PostgreSQL or mongoDB you can revise from 
    2.1 the folder slide with SQL_exercise_postgreSQL or 
    2.2 the folder slide with  NoSQL_mongo_exercise

3. However, I think I need to do some actually projects to complete all necessary understanding
   (database + webdev). I think i can complete them within this december (31/12/23).
   So, For now, Don't worry to much that you will forget what you have learnt.
